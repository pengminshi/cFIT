Description: cFIT (common Factor Space Integration & Transfer) is a tool for data integration and transfer for scRNAseq data. The toolbox is build based on low rank modeling. It provides functions to estimate the model parameters via iterative non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and then used for synchronized intefration from across-domain assays, or transferring via low-rank matrix from more informative data to allow for precise identification of data of lower quality. The package also provide simulation tools.
